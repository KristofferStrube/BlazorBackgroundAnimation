# BlazorBackgroundAnimation
Test project that uses delaunay triangulation to make a background in Blazor.

## Demo
The project can be demoed at [kristofferstrube.github.io/BlazorBackgroundAnimation](https://kristofferstrube.github.io/BlazorBackgroundAnimation/)

## Future Work
Future work for this project would be to make this into a Blazor Component and add it as a nuget package that can easily be used to make awesome backgrounds for varying sizes of elements.
